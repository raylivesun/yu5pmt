    // 3.4 Compiler
    // A compiler is another tool that reads the instructions of a program from source
    // code. Different from an interpreter, it does not execute the code; rather, it
    // produces a program written in another language (usually machine code). This
    // produced program is responsible for the execution of the instructions that were
    // written by the programmer. From the point of view of the programmer, executing
    // with a compiler involves three steps: writing the source code, compiling it, and
    // running the produced program.
    void compiler(tool, program, source)(ref write)
    {
        tool program;
        source.write("The select compiler tools source program:.");
