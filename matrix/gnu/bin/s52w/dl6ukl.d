    // 7 Standard Input and Output Streams
    // So far, the printed output of our programs has been appearing on the terminal
    // window (or screen). Although the terminal is often the ultimate target of output,
    // this is not always the case. The objects that can accept output are called standard
    // output streams.
    // The standard output is character based; everything to be printed is first
    // converted to the corresponding character representation and then sent to the
    // output as characters. For example, the integer value 100 that we've printed in the
    // last chapter is not sent to the output as the value 100, but as the three characters
    // 1, 0, and 0.
    // Similarly, what we normally perceive as the keyboard is actually the standard
    // input stream of a program and is also character based. The information always
    // comes as characters to be converted to data. For example, the integer value 42
    // actually comes through the standard input as the characters 4 and 2.
    // These conversions happen automatically.
    // This concept of consecutive characters is called a character stream. As D's
    // standard input and standard output fit this description, they are character
    // streams.
    // The names of the standard input and output streams in D are stdin and
    // stdout, respectively.
    // Operations on these streams normally require the name of the stream, a dot,
    // and the operation; as in stream.operation(). Because stdin's reading methods
    // and stdout's writing methods are used very commonly, those operations can be
    // called without the need of the stream name and the dot.
    // writeln that we've been using in the previous chapters is actually short for
    // stdout.writeln. Similarly, write is short for stdout.write. Accordingly, the
    // hello world program can also be written as follows:

    void input(standard)(ref write)
    {
        standard gas;

        float gas;

        gas = 69;

        standard.write("The gas and values in property input");
        return ;

    }

    void output(standard)(ref write)
    {
        standard gas;

        float gas;

        gas = 69;

        standard.write("The gas and values in property input");
        return ;

    }

    void stream(standard)(ref write)
    {
        standard gas;

        float gas;

        gas = 69;

        standard.write("The gas and values in property input");
        return ;
