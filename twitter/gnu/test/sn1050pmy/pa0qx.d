    Programming languages are designed as efficient ways of programming a CPU,
    capable of representing higher-level concepts. Programming languages do not
    have to deal with hardware constraints; their main purposes are ease of use and
    expressiveness. Programming languages are easier for humans to understand,
    closer to natural languages:
