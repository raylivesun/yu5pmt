    // Unlike an interpreter, the compiler reads and understands the source code only

    // runs faster compared to executing that program with an interpreter. Compilers
    // usually perform advanced analysis on the code, which help with producing fast
    // programs and catching programming errors before the program even starts
    // running. On the other hand, having to compile the program every time it is
    // changed is a complication and a potential source of human errors. Moreover, the
    // programs that are produced by a compiler can usually run only on a specific
    // platform; to run on a different kind of processor or on a different operating
    // system, the program would have to be recompiled. Additionally, the languages
    // that are easy to compile are usually less dynamic than those that run in an
    // interpreter.
