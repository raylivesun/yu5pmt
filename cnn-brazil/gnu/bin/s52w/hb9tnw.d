    // 8 Reading from the Standard Input
    // Any data that is read by the program must first be stored in a variable. For
    // example, a program that reads the number of students from the input must store
    // this information in a variable. The type of this specific variable can be int.
    // As we've seen in the previous chapter, we don't need to type stdout when
    // printing to the output, because it is implied. Further, what is to be printed is
    // specified as the argument. So, write(studentCount) is sufficient to print the
    // value of studentCount. To summarize:
