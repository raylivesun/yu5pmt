    // 6 Variables
    // Concrete concepts that are represented in a program are called variables. A value
    // like air temperature and a more complicated object like a car engine can be
    // variables of a program.
    // The main purpose of a variable is to represent a value in the program. The
    // value of a variable is the last value that has been assigned to that variable. Since
    // every value is of a certain type, every variable is of a certain type as well. Most
    // variables have names as well, but some variables are anonymous.
    // As an example of a variable, we can think of the concept of the number of
    // students at a school. Since the number of students is a whole number, int is a
    // suitable type, and studentCount would be a sufficiently descriptive name.
    // According to D's syntax rules, a variable is introduced by its type followed by its
    // name. The introduction of a variable to the program is called its definition. Once a
    // variable is defined, its name represents its value.

    void main(studentCount, count, school)(ref write)
    {
        int[1][2][3] studentCount;
        float[4][5][6] count;

        count.write("The number values descriptor count");
